/**
 * Represents a group of contiguous pixels in an image.
 * The top-left cell of the array (row:0, column:0) is considered to be coordinate (x:0, y:0).
 * Y increases downward and X increases to the right. For example, (row:4, column:7)
 * corresponds to (x:7, y:4).
 * 
 * A group's size indicates the number of pixels in the group.
 * The centroid of the group is computed as the average of the pixel coordinates in each
 * dimension using integer division.
 * This means the x coordinate of the centroid is the sum of all x values divided by the
 * number of pixels in the group, and similarly for the y coordinate.
 * 
 * Groups are naturally comparable. The comparison is done first by the group's size,
 * then by the x coordinate of the centroid, and finally by the y coordinate.
 * In a method that returns groups, they should be sorted in this natural order.
